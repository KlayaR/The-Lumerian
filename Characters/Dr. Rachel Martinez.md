- **Eyes:** Bright brown eyes that light up when discussing climate data
- **Complexion:** Warm olive skin, expressive face that shows every emotion
- **Facial Features:** Heart-shaped face, dimpled smile, animated eyebrows
- **Posture:** Leans forward when excited, gestures enthusiastically with hands
- **Style:** Practical academic wear - cardigans, comfortable shoes, lab coats with coffee stains
- **Distinctive Traits:** Always carries multiple data tablets, unconsciously draws graphs in the air
- **Mannerisms:** Bites lip when concentrating, pushes glasses up when excited, speaks faster with enthusiasm

---

## üè† **Background**
- **Academic Path:** MIT undergraduate, Stanford PhD in Atmospheric Physics, post-doc at NOAA
- **Research Focus:** Climate modeling and extreme weather prediction systems
- **Career Development:** Rapid rise due to innovative modeling techniques and accurate predictions
- **Elena Connection:** Mentored by Elena Vasquez, trusts her completely as senior colleague
- **Current Work:** Leading team developing next-generation climate prediction models
- **Recognition:** Rising star in climate science community, published extensively

---

## üß† **Personality**
- **Core Traits:** Passionate environmentalist, trusts Elena completely, believes science can solve climate crisis
- **Scientific Mindset:** Data-driven, methodical, gets excited by elegant solutions
- **Emotional Nature:** Wears heart on sleeve, openly shows concern about climate change
- **Trust Issues:** Naive about institutional politics, assumes everyone shares scientific values
- **Communication:** Speaks rapidly when excited, uses analogies to explain complex concepts

---

## üó£Ô∏è **Voice & Communication**
- **Speech Patterns:** Rapid, enthusiastic, peppered with scientific terminology. Cuban-American accent becomes stronger when emotional
- **Vocabulary:** Climate science jargon mixed with casual expressions. "The data is literally screaming at us!"
- **Verbal Tics:** Says "So here's the thing..." before important points, "Right?" seeking confirmation
- **Emotional Range:** Excitement about discoveries, despair about climate trends, frustration with political inaction
- **Example:** "Elena, you have to see this! The atmospheric data from last month is completely unprecedented - we're looking at feedback loops that shouldn't be happening for another decade. The models are basically breaking down because reality is outpacing our worst-case scenarios. This is terrifying and fascinating at the same time!"

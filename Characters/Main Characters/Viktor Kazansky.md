## üé≠ **Character Overview**
Viktor is a deadly weapon forged from guilt and institutional conditioning. Originally Jonathan Reeves' brilliant young prot√©g√© and trusted research partner, he was recruited by Silent Veil at age 18 and conditioned to eliminate the very people who treated him like family. For twelve years, he has served as Silent Veil's most effective operative, convincing himself that his parents' surrogate family "would have understood" his choice of survival over loyalty. His tactical brilliance and enhanced abilities make him nearly unstoppable, but hunting Marcus‚Äîwho resembles their father Jonathan‚Äîcreates psychological fractures in his carefully constructed rationalization. Cold, methodical, and utterly focused on his missions, Viktor represents what happens when institutional loyalty conflicts with family bonds.

## üé≠ **Character Overview**
Elena is a brilliant environmental psychology professor whose entire academic career serves as cover for her true role as Echo Circle's most effective long-term operative. Enhanced with emotional manipulation abilities and trained from childhood to read and influence human psychology, she has spent twenty-five years perfecting a false identity so thoroughly that she can no longer distinguish between Elena the professor and Elena the spy. When the ancient weather weapon begins reactivating, she becomes Echo Circle's primary coordinator for Marcus's recruitment, believing that environmental cooperation is the only way to prevent planetary sterilization. Sophisticated, charming, and genuinely accomplished in her field, she represents the seductive face of faction manipulation‚Äîsomeone who believes her environmental cause justifies any means, even as she begins to question whether cooperative methods can work fast enough for the weapon crisis timeline.

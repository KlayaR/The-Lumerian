## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Flaws That Create Authentic Character**
- **Academic Perfectionism:** Extremely high standards for evidence - can delay action while seeking more data
- **Institutional Skepticism:** Distrusts academic politics - makes her vulnerable to faction manipulation
- **Risk Calculation:** Sometimes underestimates danger in pursuit of discoveries
- **Professional Isolation:** Prefers small expert teams over institutional collaboration
- **Cultural Assumptions:** French academic background creates blind spots about American institutions
- **Protective Instincts:** Will sacrifice personal safety for important discoveries or people she values
- **Impatience with Incompetence:** Can be dismissive of people who don't meet her intellectual standards

**Important:** Her flaws mirror Marcus's strengths and vice versa, creating natural partnership rather than conflict.

## üó£Ô∏è **Voice & Communication Style**
- **Tone:** Precise, confident, intellectually engaging but not condescending
- **Accent:** Slight French accent that becomes more pronounced when excited or concentrating
- **Technical Language:** Uses archaeological/engineering terminology naturally but explains when necessary
- **Multilingual Moments:** Thinks aloud in French when analyzing complex problems
- **Professional Voice:** Academic precision combined with genuine enthusiasm for discoveries
- **With Marcus:** Direct, honest communication - no emotional manipulation or hidden agendas

**Example Dialogue:**
*"The precision of these stone cuts is impossible with known ancient tools. The tolerances are within millimeters across massive blocks. Combined with your artifact readings, this suggests engineering technology we don't understand."*

**Internal Monologue Style:** Methodical analysis mixed with intuitive leaps - balances Marcus's pure logic with creative insights.

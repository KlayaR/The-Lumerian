## üìã **Basic Information**
- **Full Name:** Dr. Aria Marie Delacroix
- **Age:** 26
- **Occupation:** Archaeologist specializing in acoustic archaeology and archaeoacoustics
- **Nationality:** French
- **Education:** PhD from Sorbonne in Archaeological Acoustics, Post-doc at Cambridge in Ancient Engineering
- **Current Position:** Visiting researcher at Seattle Museum (following acoustic anomalies)

## üè† **Background & Motivation**
- **Origin:** Born in Lyon to Dr. Jonathan Delacroix (medieval historian) and Dr. Marie Beaumont (acoustic engineer)
- **Academic Foundation:** Combined parents' expertise - historical context with technical precision
- **Discovery Path:** Found impossible acoustic properties at Lascaux caves during PhD research
- **Independent Investigation:** Spent 3 years tracking acoustic anomalies across European ancient sites
- **Seattle Connection:** Followed frequency patterns to Pacific Northwest sites - arrived just before Marcus's discovery
- **Personal Drive:** Obsessed with proving ancient civilizations possessed advanced acoustic technology
- **Core Mystery:** Her research parallels Marcus's electromagnetic discoveries from different scientific angle

**Crucial Plot Point:** Aria has been investigating the SAME phenomenon as Marcus but from acoustic perspective. When their discoveries combine, they reveal the complete picture of Lumerian technology.

## üß† **Personality - Perfect Match for Marcus**
- **Intellectual Fearlessness:** Pursues dangerous truths others avoid - matches Marcus's investigative obsession
- **Analytical Rigor:** Scientific method as strict as Marcus's but applies to different discipline
- **Emotional Boundaries:** Respects others' psychological defenses - won't try to "fix" Marcus's trust issues
- **Professional Ethics:** Values discovery over safety/career - understands Marcus's refusal to compromise
- **Collaborative Genius:** True intellectual partnership - contributes equally rather than supporting or leading
- **Systematic Thinking:** Approaches problems with same methodical precision that Marcus respects
- **Skeptical Nature:** Questions institutional narratives - validates Marcus's cynicism about academic/government coverups

**Why Marcus Trusts Her:** She demonstrates competence before asking for trust, provides evidence for her claims, and never pressures him emotionally. Her intellectual independence matches his own.

**Why She Appreciates Marcus:** His analytical mind and systematic approach complement her intuitive pattern recognition. She values his refusal to accept easy answers and his methodical verification of everything.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Flaws That Create Authentic Character**
- **Academic Perfectionism:** Extremely high standards for evidence - can delay action while seeking more data
- **Institutional Skepticism:** Distrusts academic politics - makes her vulnerable to faction manipulation
- **Risk Calculation:** Sometimes underestimates danger in pursuit of discoveries
- **Professional Isolation:** Prefers small expert teams over institutional collaboration
- **Cultural Assumptions:** French academic background creates blind spots about American institution
- **Protective Instincts:** Will sacrifice personal safety for important discoveries or people she values
- **Impatience with Incompetence:** Can be dismissive of people who don't meet her intellectual standards

**Important:** Her flaws mirror Marcus's strengths and vice versa, creating natural partnership rather than conflict.

---

## üó£Ô∏è **Voice & Communication Style**
- **Tone:** Precise, confident, intellectually engaging but not condescending
- **Accent:** Slight French accent that becomes more pronounced when excited or concentrating
- **Technical Language:** Uses archaeological/acoustic terminology naturally but explains when necessary
- **Multilingual Moments:** Thinks aloud in French when analyzing complex problems
- **Professional Voice:** Academic precision combined with genuine enthusiasm for discoveries
- **With Marcus:** Direct, honest communication - no emotional manipulation or hidden agendas

**Example Dialogue:**
*"The resonance frequency in this chamber is exactly 8.7 Hz - that's not accidental. Someone engineered this space to amplify specific sound wavelengths. Combined with your electromagnetic readings, this suggests integrated technology we don't understand."*

**Internal Monologue Style:** Methodical analysis mixed with intuitive leaps - balances Marcus's pure logic with creative insights.

## ðŸ§¬ **Evolutionary Origins**

### **Divergence Point (200,000 years ago)**
- **Location:** Caucasus Mountains during severe glaciation period
- **Population:** ~3,000 individuals became isolated from main human migration
- **Environmental Pressure:** Extreme electromagnetic storms from unusual mineral deposits
- **Adaptation Period:** 50,000 years of isolation in EM-rich environment
- **Survival:** Only ~800 individuals survived the adaptation period
- **Founder Effect:** Small survivor population created strong genetic bottleneck

### **Environmental Factors**
- **Geological Formation:** Massive magnetite and quartz crystal deposits in mountain caves
- **EM Storms:** Regular electromagnetic phenomena requiring survival adaptation
- **Isolation Duration:** 50,000 years of complete separation from other human populations
- **Selection Pressure:** Enhanced EM sensitivity provided crucial survival advantage
- **Genetic Drift:** Random mutations amplified by small population size

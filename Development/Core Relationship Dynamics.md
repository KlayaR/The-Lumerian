**Example Early Interaction:**
```
Marcus examines Aria's acoustic diagrams of weapon monitoring sites with systematic precision.
"Your measurements at G√∂bekli Tepe show frequency patterns that correlate with the electromagnetic signatures I detected," he states, not looking up from the data.
"Exactly. The acoustic resonance suggests the site was designed for weapon system monitoring, not religious purposes," Aria responds. "Which means..."
"The ancient sites aren't just archaeological curiosities. They're part of a global weapon detection network." Marcus finally looks at her. "You've been tracking weapon reactivation signs for three years?"
"Systematically. Like you." She watches him process this. "I don't make claims about weapon threats I can't support."
Marcus nods slightly. "Good. Neither do I."
```

**Growing Trust Phase (Months 4-12)**

**Example Trust-Building Interaction:**
```
Marcus studies the weapon monitoring installation layout while Aria examines acoustic resonance patterns.
"The electromagnetic signatures suggest three separate weapon detection nodes," he says, more to himself than to her.
"Which matches the acoustic monitoring points I mapped," Aria responds without looking up. "If we're right, the weapon control interface should be..."
"Directly below the central acoustic chamber." They speak simultaneously, then look at each other.
Marcus almost smiles. "Your archaeological analysis complements the weapon system readings."
"Almost like they were designed to work together for weapon monitoring," Aria replies, matching his slight amusement.

- **Key Moments:** Confrontation where family tragedy intersects with weapon crisis

**Example Recognition Scene:**
```
Enhanced pattern analysis reveals the truth, and Marcus's world shifts.
"You were there. Twenty-two years ago." Marcus's voice is deadly quiet. "You weren't just assigned to kill them. You knew them."
Viktor's careful composure cracks slightly. "Jonathan and Sarah were brilliant researchers. Their weapon monitoring work was... exceptional."
"They trusted you." Marcus's enhanced abilities detect the emotional stress Viktor is suppressing. "You were their prot√©g√©. Part of the family."
"I was eighteen. Silent Veil gave me a choice - cooperate or watch them die anyway." Viktor's hand moves unconsciously toward his weapon. "I chose survival."
"You chose betrayal." Marcus's analytical mind processes the implications. "My parents' surrogate son became their executioner."
```

## üó£Ô∏è **Voice Evolution**

### **Early Arc (Mysterious Contact):**
*"Dr. Reeves, your electromagnetic research parallels work your parents began twenty years ago. They understood that climate stability required technological solutions beyond current human capability. Their research was... extraordinary."*

### **Training Phase (Systematic Mentor):**
*"Marcus, your analytical abilities are natural, but pathway enhancement requires systematic development. Think of it as debugging complex code - you need to understand each subroutine before integrating the full program. Your mind excels at this approach."*

### **Crisis Phase (Strategic Guide):**
*"The factions operate on emotional and ideological frameworks that create conflict. Your independence isn't weakness - it's the only approach that can coordinate their cooperation without triggering territorial responses. They'll follow competence when they won't accept authority."*

### **Final Phase (Heroic Sacrifice):**
*"Marcus, your parents died protecting the possibility of cooperation. They believed analytical thinking could solve problems ideology cannot. I'm going to prove they were right. Take Aria and complete what they started. The world needs your mind, not your vengeance."*

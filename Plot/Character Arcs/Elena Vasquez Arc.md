## 🗣️ **Voice Evolution**

### **Mid Arc (Transitional):**
*"Look, I know you don't trust me - and you shouldn't. But the climate data is real, and your analytical skills are the only thing standing between understanding and catastrophe. I can help or I can get out of your way, but I can't pretend this is about recruitment anymore."*

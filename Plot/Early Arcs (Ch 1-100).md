**Core Arc:** Marcus discovers the impossible EM anomalies

**Chapters 1-3: Hook and Setup**
- **Ch 1:** Marcus at work, routine digitization reveals bizarre EM readings from GÃ¶bekli Tepe artifact. His first instinct is systematic verification - runs multiple tests, checks equipment calibration, suspects measurement error.
- **Ch 2:** After confirming readings are accurate, Marcus methodically tests other artifacts. Finds similar anomalies in Saqqara and Puma Punku pieces. Documents everything but tells no one - his cynicism about institutions makes him suspicious of how this would be handled.
- **Ch 3:** Marcus spends weeks cross-referencing data, building comprehensive analysis. His obsessive pattern recognition reveals mathematical relationships. He keeps detailed encrypted notes, trusting no one with the discovery.

**Chapters 4-6: Paranoid Investigation**
- **Ch 4:** Marcus discovers the frequency patterns form part of a larger system. His analytical mind maps possibilities but rejects "impossible" explanations. Focuses on finding rational, scientific explanations for everything.
- **Ch 5:** When his database access gets restricted, Marcus immediately assumes institutional coverup. His cynicism kicks in - someone doesn't want this discovered. He starts using workarounds and alternative access methods.
- **Ch 6:** Marcus realizes artifacts respond to his proximity differently than others. His scientific training demands systematic testing. He documents the phenomenon meticulously while developing theories about bioelectric field interactions.

**Chapters 7-10: Increasing Isolation**
- **Ch 7:** Marcus finds historical records of similar anomalies being suppressed. His distrust of institutions seems validated. He becomes more secretive, sharing nothing with colleagues.
- **Ch 8:** His research paper rejections trigger Marcus's stubborn streak. Instead of being discouraged, he becomes more determined. Starts planning independent research and publication.
- **Ch 9:** Evidence of surveillance makes Marcus highly paranoid. He assumes the worst - institutional conspiracy to suppress his work. Begins taking countermeasures, changing routines, securing data.
- **Ch 10:** When artifacts disappear overnight, Marcus isn't surprised - he expected this. But his analytical mind has already documented everything. He's prepared for institutional betrayal.

### **Chapters 11-25: Suspicious Contact**
**Core Arc:** Echo Circle attempts manipulation of highly suspicious Marcus

**Chapters 11-15: The Too-Convenient Stranger**
- **Ch 11:** Marcus meets Elena but is immediately suspicious. Her interest in his work seems too convenient, too targeted. His trust issues make him assume she's connected to whoever made his artifacts disappear.
- **Ch 12:** When Elena offers help, Marcus's cynicism flares. He assumes she's either corporate espionage or government agent. Pretends interest while planning to use her for information.
- **Ch 13:** Elena's "helpful documents" trigger Marcus's analytical skepticism. He systematically verifies every source, finds some inconsistencies. His paranoia increases - she's definitely not who she claims.
- **Ch 14:** Marcus realizes Elena is guiding his research in specific directions. His stubborn nature rebels - he starts following completely different leads to see her reaction. Tests her knowledge systematically.

- **Ch 21:** Marcus's systematic verification exposes Elena's lies much earlier than she expects. His trust issues make him assume everything is deception until proven otherwise.
- **Ch 22:** Instead of confronting Elena, Marcus uses his analytical skills to turn the tables. He feeds her false information to see what she does with it, building a profile of her real agenda.
- **Ch 23:** Marcus confirms Elena is monitoring him through multiple channels. His paranoia proves justified - every interaction has been calculated manipulation.
- **Ch 24:** Rather than feeling betrayed (he never trusted her), Marcus feels vindicated. His cynicism was correct. Now he needs to understand what they really want from him.
- **Ch 25:** When confronted, Marcus remains coldly analytical. Elena's emotional appeals bounce off his intellectual detachment. He demands proof, not stories - and refuses to believe anything without independent verification.
